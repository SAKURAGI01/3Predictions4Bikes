### There are three folders named LSTM, Transformer, TNN - BEATS, and a data folder. They store three corresponding prediction models and the data used by the models respectively.
### In the LSTM folder, [describe the content here if there is any specific information].
### In the Transformer folder, [describe the content here if there is any specific information].
### In the TNN - BEATS folder, train_96h.py and train_240h.py are training codes. test_96h.py and test_240h.py are codes for testing and comparing the real - predicted values (including graphing). std_cmp_96h.py and std_cmp_240h.py are codes for comparing the five - round training and standard deviation (including graphing). std_cmp_96h_plot.py and std_cmp_240h_plot.py are graphing codes for standard deviation comparison.
### In the data folder, train_data.csv is the training data and test_data.csv is the test data.
